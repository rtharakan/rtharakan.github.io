<!--
<p>Hi. I’m Sameer Vasta, a snail-mail boy living in an email world, and over-user of the discretionary comma.</p>
<p>After spending most of my life in Toronto, New York, and Washington DC,&nbsp;I now live with my incredible wife, my wonderful daughter, and our adorable cat in our beautiful home in London, Ontario.</p>
<p>I’m a public policy and public affairs professional with an academic background in cultural anthropology, and have worked on various projects in the areas of public sector transformation, digital government,&nbsp;open data, energy conservation, healthcare transformation,&nbsp;international development, and organizational change.</p>
<p>I was one of the co-founders of the <a href="http://ontario.ca/digital">Ontario Digital Service</a>, and spent many years there until <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/dissolution-of-ods">its dissolution recently</a>. I’m now working in the Ontario Public Service, focused on people, specifically employee experience and organizational design.</p>
<p>Until a few years ago, I taught the<span class="push-double"></span> <span class="pull-double">“</span>Government in a Digital Era” course in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/master-of-public-service/home">University of Waterloo Masters of Public Service</a> program and served on the Board of the <a href="http://ckx.org">Community Knowledge Exchange</a>, and the <a href="https://www.urbanleague.ca">Urban League of London</a>. I’m also an advisor for a few small non-profit organizations and social enterprises, and a mentor to a handful of early-career public servants. Once my daughter grows up a little, I’m hoping to get back involved in non-profit governance and teaching, and would love to chat.</p>
<p>I pass my time reading my never-ending stack of library books, writing letters to penpals, and exploring the urban landscape on foot. I find beauty in the mundane and joy in the small things. If you’re ever in the area, <a href="mailto:sv@sameervasta.com">come join me on my aimless strolls around the city</a>, or for an espresso and conversation; I love making new friends.</p>

        <h1 id="about-this-site.">About this site.</h1>
<!--
<p><em>flashing palely in the margins</em> is a collection of essays, marginalia, and miscellaneous musings that pass through my mind from time to time. I’ve been operating this space online, with various names over the years, <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/twenty-years-old">since 1998</a>. Sadly, I lost all my archives when I forgot to back up my server in 2005, so what you’ll find here is whatever I managed to save after that.</p>
<p>The title, <em>flashing palely in the margins</em>, is taken from <a href="http://lithub.com/where-do-book-titles-come-from/">an article published by Dustin Illingworth in LitHub on December 2, 2015</a>. Dustin’s article was on finding book titles; the passage resonated with me because it reminded me that so much of what I find joyful and beautiful in life is hidden in the margins, flashing palely, waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>This blog is published from southwest London (Ontario), Treaty 2 Territory, the traditional lands of the Anishinaabek, Haudenosaunee, Lūnaapéewak and Attawandaron people; I recognize and am grateful for the stewardship of this land by those who came before me and those who continue to call this land their home.</p>
